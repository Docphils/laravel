## About Laravel
Laragram is my first completed Laravel project. It is a mini Instagram clone with a couple of functionalities. I used Laravel Breeze for scaffolding and the blade template for the front end.
This project is only a stepping stone to building many other simple, complex and advanced Laravel projects exploring other front end tools like React and Bootstrap. 

I will appreciate your contributions to this project as well as collaboration opportunies.
